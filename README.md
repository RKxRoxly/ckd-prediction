# Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction

### **Project Title**
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Risk Assessment System using Logistic Regression

### **Problem Statement**
Kidney disease often goes undetected until late stages. This tool provides an early screening method using laboratory metrics.

### **Objective**
To build a reliable classification model that helps identify patients at risk of CKD based on clinical data.

### **Dataset Description**
The model uses features like Age, BP, Specific Gravity, Albumin, Glucose, Creatinine, and Hemoglobin.

### **Methodology / Approach**
- Data cleaning and mean imputation for missing values.
- Implementation of **Logistic Regression** for binary classification.
- Frontend development using **Streamlit**.

### **Tools & Technologies Used**
- Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, Streamlit

### **Results / Output**
The application generates a 'High Risk' or 'Low Risk' result based on input parameters.
